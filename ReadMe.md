Instructions:
    The purpose of this project is to help non-medical home care aides who work 100% remotely with their work life. This can range from, checking into the location of their clients, having a list of tasks to complete for each client, turning in time sheets which currently need to be done by hand and turned in person, and get certified in new tasks via online accessable tests.
    You'd have to create a login with your name, email and password. Once created, you can login in later with your email and password. Once logged in, you can either check into the location of your client, check your work schedule by the month, week or day, check your list of tasks with the checklist, go to the learning center to take certification tests or learn more about your industry or click the HIPPA Information button to learn more about HIPPA.
